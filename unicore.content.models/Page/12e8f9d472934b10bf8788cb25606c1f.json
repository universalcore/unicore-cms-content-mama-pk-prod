When he is born he will be able to see, taste, smell and hear. \r\n\r\nYour body is already getting ready to feed your baby precious mother\u2019s milk. The changes you notice will help you make milk for your baby and make sure the baby can feed well. \r\n\r\nYour skin may be changing as well. Dark patches of skin may develop on your face. Or you may get a dark line down your belly. These can be made worse by being out in the sun, so cover your skin and head, or stay in the shade. They will fade after your baby is born.\r\n\r\nPregnancy makes the joints in your body looser. So you may find you get aches and pains when you carry something heavy. Take care when lifting things. Divide heavy items into smaller loads. It is important to try to take more rest as well. Try to rest each afternoon and go to bed early if you are feeling tired. Growing a baby is hard work!\r\n\r\nReviewed by Friends of the White Ribbon Alliance\r\n",
