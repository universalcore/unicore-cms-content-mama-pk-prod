  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nMost babies turn so that they are head down about now. It is the best position to be in.  You may notice that your baby moves lower down as well. This makes it easier for you to breathe, but it also means that you need to urinate more often! \r\n\r\nIf you have swelling low down where you can feel your baby\u2019s head, rest lying down, with your feet up, perhaps on a cushion or pad of cloth when you can, to reduce the swelling. \r\n\r\nYour baby has developed all his internal organs fully now. Inside you, he is swallowing the liquid around him   and then passing it out again. His lungs are fully grown and will work as soon he takes his first breath.\r\n\r\nTry to rest each day and think about the baby you are growing. Soon you will see him. Your baby can hear your voice and will recognize you when you say hello to him for the first time!\r\n\r\nYou may feel fewer big movements because it is quite cramped inside you now. But you should still feel your baby kick regularly. If you are not sure, sit quietly after a meal and notice how often he kicks. If you do not count several kicks see a nurse, doctor or midwife.\r\n",
